# Alien-Catcher-Project-
The Alien Signal Catcher project is an embedded systems application that combines technical functionality with an interactive game experience.

The system is designed around the concept of intercepting alien signals, providing a creative narrative to demonstrate principles of motor control, timing, and finite state machines. Players engage with the system through three selectable difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level adjusts the timing and randomness of incoming signals to create progressively greater challenges.

In Easy mode, signals occur quickly and predictably, allowing players to familiarize themselves with the mechanics. Medium mode introduces a wider range of signal delays, requiring faster reflexes and greater attention. Hard mode increases both the delay range and unpredictability of signals, testing focus, patience, and precision under pressure.

The project incorporates an LCD screen and LED indicators to enhance user interaction and provide immediate feedback. Messages such as “Signal Received” or “Signal Jammed” are displayed to reflect the outcome of player actions. The LCD also records performance metrics such as best response times, motivating players to improve through repeated play.

By integrating structured game mechanics with real-time embedded programming, the Alien Signal Catcher demonstrates how technical concepts can be applied in an engaging format. It serves as both a functional engineering project and an imaginative application of interactive design principles
